# Project Mission

The AgentPsy project is dedicated to assessing and analyzing the personality traits and cognitive stability of large language models through scientific methods. We believe that understanding and mastering the intrinsic characteristics of AI systems is crucial for building safer and more reliable artificial intelligence applications.

## Core Objectives

- **Scientific Assessment**: Develop and apply scientific evaluation methods to comprehensively analyze the personality traits of large language models.
- **Cognitive Stability Research**: Conduct in-depth research on the cognitive stability and consistency of models in different contexts.
- **Open and Transparent**: Publicize our evaluation methods and results to promote exchange and collaboration between academia and industry.
- **Application-Oriented**: Apply research results to real-world scenarios to enhance the reliability and safety of AI systems.

## Vision

We hope that through the AgentPsy project, we can contribute to the healthy development of artificial intelligence and promote the construction of a more trustworthy and controllable AI ecosystem.
