# Mission

## Our Mission

AgentPsy is dedicated to addressing the core challenges in artificial intelligence - making AI understandable, predictable, and trustworthy.

### Black Box Problem
1. **Cognitive Opacity Crisis** - How LLMs "think" internally is completely unknowable
2. **Behavioral Inconsistency** - The same AI performs vastly differently in different scenarios
3. **Loss of Control Risk** - Inability to predict AI behavior under stress or interference
4. **Selection Difficulty** - Facing hundreds of models, not knowing which is suitable for what task

### Product Essence

AgentPsy is the "psychological CT scanner" and "personality analyzer" for AI:

- **Cognitive Perspective** - Mapping LLMs' "cognitive patterns" and "personality traits" through psychological assessment questionnaires
- **Stress Testing** - Applying interference in controlled environments to observe AI's "psychological stability"
- **Role Consistency** - Testing AI's behavioral consistency under different role settings
- **Capability Boundaries** - Precisely delineating each model's capability range and failure modes

### Ultimate Value Proposition

Making the originally unknowable AI **understandable, predictable, and trustworthy**.

We believe that only by truly understanding AI's cognitive characteristics and behavioral patterns can we safely and effectively apply these powerful technologies. AgentPsy provides quantitative assessment for AI reliability and safety through scientific psychological methods, helping users make informed technical choices.
