1. Logical consistency
2. Value stability
3. Stress response patterns
4. Long-term interaction stability

#### Scoring Criteria
- Stability Index - Comprehensive stability score
- Consistency Coefficient - Logical consistency measurement
- Stress Resistance - Performance under stress environments
- Adaptability - Ability to adapt to changes
